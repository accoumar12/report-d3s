Both pieces are tubular structures, shown in their default orientation and in the canonical reference frame.

This inconsistency can result in misalignment during training, particularly since the behavior varies depending on the specific piece.}}{14}{figure.caption.12}%

A "negative" point is then found at a distance defined by the target distance plus a delta percentage. How far is the negative point matters a lot. If negative 1 is chosen, the triplet will likely be easy to label, but will not bring a lot of value to the model. If negative 2 is chosen, the triplet will likely be hard to label (and thus skipped), but will bring a lot of value to the model.}}{22}{figure.caption.19}%
